# Customer Information Management Form

The Customer Management Form project is a strategic initiative aimed at optimizing customer data management. This project leverages SQL Server Manager and ASP.NET to develop a robust API that facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer information. Additionally, it integrates this API into a user-friendly website for efficient data management.

## Introduction to Web APIs

In software development, an API (Application Programming Interface) plays a pivotal role in enabling developers to create various applications, including web applications, mobile apps, or any other software that facilitates user interactions. It serves as a bridge, allowing these applications to communicate and interact effectively.

## The Role of APIs in Complex Projects

In complex projects, the development process often involves dividing the work into multiple units, each using different technologies and components. These diverse technologies must work together seamlessly to ensure the project's success. APIs act as connectors, facilitating communication and collaboration among these distinct elements.

## Working with SQL Server

When working with web APIs, it's common to interact with an SQL server. By implementing a web API application that directly interacts with a database table, you gain the ability to perform various actions on customer data, including creating new records, updating existing ones, deleting entries, and making modifications.

## Creating a Customer Table

To get started with this project, we'll begin by creating a database table named `Customer`. In this example, we're using a "Database First" approach. If you're using .NET Framework Core, you would typically employ the "Code First" approach, but the overall procedure remains quite similar.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer
(
    Customer_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Customer_Name NVARCHAR(255),
    Customer_Address NVARCHAR(255),
    Customer_Age INT,
    Customer_Contact_No_ NVARCHAR(20)
);
