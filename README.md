# Customer Information Management Form

The Customer Management Form project is a strategic initiative aimed at optimizing customer data management. This project leverages SQL Server Manager and ASP.NET to develop a robust API that facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer information. Additionally, it integrates this API into a user-friendly website for efficient data management.

## Introduction to Web APIs

In software development, an API (Application Programming Interface) plays a pivotal role in enabling developers to create various applications, including web applications, mobile apps, or any other software that facilitates user interactions. It serves as a bridge, allowing these applications to communicate and interact effectively.

## The Role of APIs in Complex Projects

In complex projects, the development process often involves dividing the work into multiple units, each using different technologies and components. These diverse technologies must work together seamlessly to ensure the project's success. APIs act as connectors, facilitating communication and collaboration among these distinct elements.

## Working with SQL Server

When working with web APIs, it's common to interact with an SQL server. By implementing a web API application that directly interacts with a database table, you gain the ability to perform various actions on customer data, including creating new records, updating existing ones, deleting entries, and making modifications.

## Creating a Customer Table

To get started with this project, we'll begin by creating a database table named `Customer`. In this example, we're using a "Database First" approach. If you're using .NET Framework Core, you would typically employ the "Code First" approach, but the overall procedure remains quite similar.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer
(
    [Customer_ID] INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Customer_Name NVARCHAR(255),
    Customer_Address NVARCHAR(255),
    Customer_Age INT,
    Customer_Contact_No_ NVARCHAR(20)
);
```
## Establishing a Connection between Web API and Database

To create a seamless connection between our Web API project and the database, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a .NET Framework Project

Begin by creating a .NET Framework project using Visual Studio. This project will serve as the foundation for our API integration.

### Step 2: Utilize Entity Framework

Leverage Entity Framework, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, to establish a robust link between our API and the database. Entity Framework simplifies database interactions, making it easier to manage data.

### Step 3: Create a Dedicated Controller

Within our .NET Framework project, create a dedicated controller. This controller acts as the intermediary between our API and the database, enabling us to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer data. It serves as the bridge, allowing data to flow seamlessly between the two.

### Step 4: Execute CRUD Operations

With the controller in place, you can now execute CRUD operations efficiently. Whether you need to create new customer records, retrieve existing ones, update information, or delete entries, the controller streamlines these operations.You can find the code for the controller in this repo with the name `CustomersController.cs`.

## Testing the API and Developing the Web Application

After creating our Web API, the next critical phase involves comprehensive testing to ensure its reliability and functionality. To achieve this, we'll utilize the Postman application, a powerful tool designed for API testing. With Postman, we can send various requests to our API, rigorously assessing its performance and verifying that it delivers the expected results.

Once we've thoroughly tested and confirmed the seamless operation of our API, we can proceed to develop our web application. This application will be constructed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, a widely adopted approach for building well-structured and robust web applications.

## Integrating MVC Project with Web API

After establishing our Web API within the same solution, the next essential step is to create an MVC (Model-View-Controller) project. This MVC project will work collaboratively with our Web API, serving as the user interface and functional component for efficient customer data management.

To enable seamless communication between our MVC application and the API, our initial task is to create a new controller within the MVC project. This controller assumes a critical role as the bridge connecting our web application and the API. It enables essential operations such as adding new customer records, deleting existing ones, updating information, and retrieving all customer data.
The code for this MVC controller can be found in this repo with the name `HomeController.cs`.

## Designing the Front-End for Your Website

Following the integration of our MVC project with the Web API, the next significant step is to create views or webforms for each function within the controller. This process is instrumental in crafting the front-end of our website, enabling user interaction and visualization of customer data.

To accomplish this, we'll add a new view or webform for each operation handled by the controller. These views serve as the user interface components that allow users to interact with the application seamlessly. Whether it's adding new customer information, deleting existing records, updating data, or retrieving comprehensive lists of customer details, these views provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface. All the Views code can be found in this repo with the name `Home`, and for the overall Layout go to `Shared`.
