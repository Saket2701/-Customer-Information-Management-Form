# Customer Information Management Form
The Customer Management Form project represents a strategic initiative aimed at optimizing customer data management. This project leverages SQL Server Manager and ASP.NET to develop a robust API that facilitates CRUD operations on customer information. Additionally, it integrates this API into a user-friendly website for efficient data management. 
## Creating a Web API 
First, let's delve into the significance of creating an web APIs. An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, plays a pivotal role in the world of technology. It serves as a bridge that enables developers to create various applications, be it a web application, a mobile app, or any other software, facilitating user interactions. 

In the course of developing a project, especially when it's a complex endeavor, it often gets divided into multiple units. This division results in the incorporation of different technologies and components. These diverse technologies need to communicate and collaborate effectively to ensure the project's success. This is where APIs come into play, as they facilitate seamless interaction between these distinct elements.

Working with web APIs often necessitates the use of an SQL server. After implementing a web API application that can directly interact with a database table you'll have the capability to perform a range of actions, such as creating records, updating existing ones, deleting entries, and making modifications. 

Let's start by creating a table. I'd like to clarify that I'll be employing a "Database First" approach. In case you're using .NET Framework Core, you would typically employ the "Code First" approach, but the overall procedure remains quite similar. 

'''CREATE TABLE Customer
(
    Customer_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Customer_Name NVARCHAR(255),
    Customer_Address NVARCHAR(255),
    Customer_Age INT,
    Customer_Contact_No_ NVARCHAR(20)
);'''
